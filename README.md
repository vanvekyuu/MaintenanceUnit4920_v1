# MaintenanceUnit4920_v1
A little project that I kinda never really complete after learning that I didn't have the Service Pack 6 that is required to compile the application （◞‸◟）

So I learnt abit of Microsoft Visual Basic 6, an old Microsoft software used to create applications in the form of forms, I think aha.
It's mostly simple code that you can find on the internet, and I mostly referenced from this website: https://www.vbtutor.net/
Soo this project is suppose to be like a short game and I mainly based it off my experienced at work lmaoo

Soo I'm posting this here as kind of like a stepping stone, a start to my coding journey.
And if you have any way to get Service Pack 6, do tell me (≧▽≦)

Also, if you read the title, yes it's a version 1!! 
I'm currently working on Maintenance Unit on GameMaker so hopefully it goes well :P
I actually had a project for the GameMaker version but I lost it sadly, I may like tell the whole story in a video ╰(▔∀▔)╯

Sorry if there is a lot of yapping, it's my first time using GitHub haha
If you do download this project and want to like try out the application, just only click the application and nothing else
it'll be like a 2 minute exprience aha aha and nothing else
